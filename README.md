## Catch Phrase

Catch Phrase is a single page web application based on the original game Catch Phrase. This react app allows users to play the game online with friends! This project was a pair project with Mahmoud Agamy.

### Technologies 

Catch Phrase is a frontend application with no backend. Additional dependencies include: 

- Semantic UI 
- MovieDB API 
- TV Show Maze API 

### Key Features
The full demo can be found on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CCdDihD-6g&t=4s)

Users have the ability to keep track of their score between the two teams. During a game users can switch between categories optimizing the fun and giving the teammates new challenges. 

## Future Development

The major focus of the application was to create an online version of Catch Phrase. With more time additional features would include: 
- Turn it into a React Native app for mobile devices
- Persist team scores, create a leaderboard displaying the team with the highest winning streak 
- Add more categories for players to choose from
